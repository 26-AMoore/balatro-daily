# Daily Run Mod

## Installation
This mod requires both [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) and [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector)
After that simply clone this repo and put it in your Mods folder
This mod has been tested on both linux and mac, and should probably work on windows

## Usage
This mod adds a new button into the start screen that allows you to complete a daily run. Everyone gets the same seed, deck, and stake. Once you complete your run pressing the button will show a leaderboard for that day

## Future Plans
- Add a better leaderboard system
- Update UI in general
- Make it faster by preloading data
- Records and global leaderboard
- Website

## Final Note

The server is ran on a raspberry pi, so sorry if there is any downtime
